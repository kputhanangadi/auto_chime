# Auto Chime

AutoChime is a project inspired by Tesla's Green Traffic Light Chime, aiming to bring this useful feature to any car, regardless of the make or model. With AutoChime, drivers can enjoy the convenience and added safety of being alerted when traffic lights change to green.

## Introduction

In the past, the Green Traffic Light Chime feature was exclusively available to Tesla owners who had purchased the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package. However, recent updates have made it accessible to owners using Autopilot or Enhanced Autopilot as well. This feature notifies the driver with a chime when they are waiting at a traffic light, indicating that the light has turned green and it is safe to proceed.

While this may seem like a minor modification, it can have a significant impact. Distractions at traffic lights are common, and drivers often face impatience from those behind them if they don't promptly notice the light change. By implementing AutoChime, drivers of any car can benefit from an audible notification as soon as the traffic lights switch to green. It is important to note that the chime is designed as an aid and drivers should still visually confirm the change before moving their vehicle.

## Features

- Universal compatibility: AutoChime is designed to work with any car, irrespective of its make or model.
- Traffic light detection: The system uses advanced computer vision techniques to detect traffic lights accurately.
- Real-time notifications: Once a traffic light turns green, AutoChime emits an audible notification to alert the driver promptly.
- Safety enhancement: By reducing the likelihood of driver distraction, AutoChime aims to enhance safety at traffic lights and promote responsible driving habits.
